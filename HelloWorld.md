## This is a Markdown File

Created as part of the coursera project for "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" Course on Coursera.org

This line is a test, to see if the push function of git bash works. :)


I added the text on line 7 using notepad.  After the change, I use the CLI in git bash to 
add the changes using "git add -A" then "git commit -m "" with a message of the changes made.
then "git push" to update the file located on github.com
All this text was entered through github
now I will pull this change to the local file on my comp.
